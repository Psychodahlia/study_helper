## Code of Conduct

This group was created as a safe space for all members including our staff.
So please be kind, respectful, helpful, and professional. If it helps ask yourself, “if my future boss was in this group, would I want them to see that” before you post publicly? 

**Be Respectful:** Always treat others with kindness and respect. Disagreements are okay, but keep the conversation civil and constructive.

**No Harassment:** Harassment of any kind, including offensive language, personal attacks, or belittling others, will not be tolerated.

**Constructive Feedback Only:** When offering feedback, make sure it’s helpful and supportive. Focus on the work, not the person.

**Respect Privacy:** Don’t share private messages or sensitive information from the channel without explicit permission.

**No Trolling or Disruptive Behavior:** Avoid posting messages intended to provoke or disrupt the flow of conversations.

**Listen to Others:** Let everyone have a chance to speak and contribute. Avoid interrupting or dominating the conversation.

**Be Inclusive:** Ensure your posts are welcoming and inclusive to all members, regardless of background or experience level.

**Support Over Criticism:** Encourage others and highlight the positive. If there’s an issue, address it with respect and a solution-oriented mindset.

**Use Professional Language:** Keep the tone professional and courteous at all times. Avoid using inappropriate or offensive language this includes cursing or threatening behavior towards any member.

**Assume Good Intentions:** If someone’s post seems off, give them the benefit of the doubt. Ask for clarification politely before reacting.

Happy coding!
