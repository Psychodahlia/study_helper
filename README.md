# study_helper

This is a *yet-to-be-named* project created by [UpWiSE](https://upwisesc.org/)

Most folks know how to use ChatGPT or other generative AI tools to gather information, but not necessarily to their best ability.

We'd like to build a useful AI tool to help people who want to study something, but are overwhelmed with the sheer number of resources there are to learn the concepts. We'll start with useful software engineering skills so this will be immediately useful to our community, but the concept can apply to anything you desire.

The ultimate goal is to alleviate "analysis paralysis" and let the tool design a curriculum for you.

Given the time the user has to study (5 min to 2 hours), the tools they have available (smartphone, tablet, laptop, pen and paper, books, etc), the environment you are in (home, airplane, coffee shop, etc), and other specific preferences, the app will return a study guide in a friendly and exportable format and include options for audio, video, text based, and interactive learning.

More to come on the use cases for this tool!
